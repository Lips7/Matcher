# Matcher

A high-performance matcher designed to solve **LOGICAL** and **TEXT VARIATIONS** problems in word matching, implemented in Rust.

For detailed implementation, see the [Design Document](../DESIGN.md).

## Features

- **Text Transformation**:
  - **Fanjian**: Simplify traditional Chinese characters to simplified ones.
    Example: `蟲艸` -> `虫艹`
  - **Delete**: Remove specific characters.
    Example: `*Fu&*iii&^%%*&kkkk` -> `Fuiiikkkk`
  - **Normalize**: Normalize special characters to identifiable characters.
    Example: `𝜢𝕰𝕃𝙻𝝧 𝙒ⓞᵣℒ𝒟!` -> `hello world!`
  - **PinYin**: Convert Chinese characters to Pinyin for fuzzy matching.
    Example: `西安` -> ` xi  an `, matches `洗按` -> ` xi  an `, but not `先` -> ` xian `
  - **PinYinChar**: Convert Chinese characters to Pinyin.
    Example: `西安` -> `xian`, matches `洗按` and `先` -> `xian`
- **AND OR NOT Word Matching**:
  - Takes into account the number of repetitions of words.
  - Example: `hello&world` matches `hello world` and `world,hello`
  - Example: `无&法&无&天` matches `无无法天` (because `无` is repeated twice), but not `无法天`
  - Example: `hello~helloo~hhello` matches `hello` but not `helloo` and `hhello`
- **Efficient Handling of Large Word Lists**: Optimized for performance.

## Usage

### Adding to Your Project

To use `matcher_rs` in your Rust project, run the following command:

```shell
cargo add matcher_rs
```

### Explanation of the configuration

#### ProcessType

* `None`: No transformation.
* `Fanjian`: Traditional Chinese to simplified Chinese transformation. Based on [FANJIAN](./process_map/FANJIAN.txt).
  * `妳好` -> `你好`
  * `現⾝` -> `现身`
* `Delete`: Delete all punctuation, special characters and white spaces. Based on [TEXT_DELETE](./process_map/TEXT-DELETE.txt) and `WHITE_SPACE`.
  * `hello, world!` -> `helloworld`
  * `《你∷好》` -> `你好`
* `Normalize`: Normalize all English character variations and number variations to basic characters. Based on [NORM](./process_map/NORM.txt) and [NUM_NORM](./process_map/NUM-NORM.txt).
  * `ℋЀ⒈㈠Õ` -> `he11o`
  * `⒈Ƨ㊂` -> `123`
* `PinYin`: Convert all unicode Chinese characters to pinyin with boundaries. Based on [PINYIN](./process_map/PINYIN.txt).
  * `你好` -> ` ni  hao `
  * `西安` -> ` xi  an `
* `PinYinChar`: Convert all unicode Chinese characters to pinyin without boundaries. Based on [PINYIN](./process_map/PINYIN.txt).
  * `你好` -> `nihao`
  * `西安` -> `xian`

You can combine these transformations as needed. Pre-defined combinations like `DeleteNormalize` and `FanjianDeleteNormalize` are provided for convenience.

Including `None` in a composite `ProcessType` keeps the raw-text path alongside transformed
variants. For example, `ProcessType::None | ProcessType::PinYin` allows one part of a rule to
match the original text while another part matches the Pinyin-transformed text.

Avoid combining `PinYin` and `PinYinChar` due to that `PinYin` is a more limited version of `PinYinChar`, in some cases like `xian`, can be treat as two words `xi` and `an`, or only one word `xian`.

### Basic Example

Here’s a basic example of how to use the `SimpleMatcher` for text matching:

```rust
use matcher_rs::{text_process, reduce_text_process, ProcessType};

let result = text_process(ProcessType::Delete, "你好，世界！");
let results = reduce_text_process(ProcessType::FanjianDeleteNormalize, "你好，世界！");
```

`text_process` returns only the final transformed text. `reduce_text_process` returns each
distinct intermediate variant along the pipeline. For shared-prefix multi-variant traversal,
`SimpleMatcher` uses the internal DAG helpers instead of recomputing each path independently.


```rust
use matcher_rs::{ProcessType, SimpleMatcherBuilder};

let matcher = SimpleMatcherBuilder::new()
    .add_word(ProcessType::Fanjian, 1, "你好")
    .add_word(ProcessType::Fanjian, 2, "世界")
    .build();

let text = "你好，世界！";
let results = matcher.process(text);
```

For more detailed usage examples, please refer to the [test_simple_matcher.rs](./tests/test_simple_matcher.rs) file.

## Feature Flags
* `runtime_build`: Build transformation tables from the source text maps at startup instead of embedding precompiled binaries.
* `dfa`: Use DFA-backed Aho-Corasick automata where applicable. This is enabled by default and improves speed at the cost of higher memory consumption.
* `simd_runtime_dispatch`: Enabled by default. Selects the best available transform kernel at runtime (`AVX2` on x86-64, `NEON` on ARM64, portable fallback elsewhere).

### Feature Comparison & Recommendation

| Feature | Engine | Search Speed | Memory Usage | External Dependency | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Default** | Aho-Corasick (DFA) | **Fast** | High | None | General purpose use when extra memory is acceptable. |
| `simd_runtime_dispatch` | Runtime-selected transform kernels | **Fastest preprocess** | Neutral | None | Portable builds that should exploit the host CPU automatically. |
| `--no-default-features` | Aho-Corasick (Contiguous NFA) | Good | **Lowest** | None | Memory-constrained environments. |
| `dfa` | Aho-Corasick (DFA) | **Fast** | High | None | Explicitly enabling the default engine in custom feature sets. |

## Benchmarks

Benchmarked on **MacBook Air M4 (24GB RAM)**.
Test data: [CN_WORD_LIST_100000](../data/word_list/cn/cn_words_100000.txt) against [CN_HAYSTACK](../data/text/cn/西游记.txt) and [EN_WORD_LIST_100000](../data/word_list/en/en_words_100000.txt) against [EN_HAYSTACK](../data/text/en/sherlock.txt).

Full records are stored in [bench_records/](./bench_records/). Latest: [latest.txt](./bench_records/latest.txt).

To compare two benchmark records:

```shell
python matcher_rs/scripts/compare_benchmarks.py \
  "matcher_rs/bench_records/2026-03-10 12:22:24.txt" \
  "matcher_rs/bench_records/2026-03-11 23:16:38.txt"
```

The script treats the first file as the baseline and prints two sections: `Regression` and `Improvement`, using median latency by default.
