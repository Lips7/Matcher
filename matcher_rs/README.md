# Matcher

A high-performance Rust matcher for rules that need both logical operators and text variation handling.

For detailed implementation, see the [Design Document](../DESIGN.md).

## Features

- Logical rule syntax with `&` and `~`
- Configurable text-transformation pipelines through `ProcessType`
- Shared-prefix transform traversal so related pipelines reuse intermediate results
- Separate bytewise and charwise matcher engines chosen from the final rule set

## Usage

### Adding to Your Project

To use `matcher_rs` in your Rust project, run the following command:

```shell
cargo add matcher_rs
```

### Explanation of the configuration

#### ProcessType

* `None`: Match against the original input text.
* `Fanjian`: Traditional Chinese to simplified Chinese conversion. Based on [FANJIAN](./process_map/FANJIAN.txt).
  * `測試` -> `测试`
  * `現⾝` -> `现身`
* `Delete`: Remove the codepoints listed in [TEXT_DELETE](./process_map/TEXT-DELETE.txt).
  * `hello, world!` -> `helloworld`
  * `《你∷好》` -> `你好`
* `Normalize`: Apply the replacement tables from [NORM](./process_map/NORM.txt) and [NUM_NORM](./process_map/NUM-NORM.txt).
  * `ＡＢⅣ①℉` -> `ab41°f`
  * `ⅠⅡⅢ` -> `123`
* `PinYin`: Convert mapped codepoints to pinyin with boundary spaces. Based on [PINYIN](./process_map/PINYIN.txt).
  * `你好` -> ` ni hao`
  * `西安` -> ` xi an`
* `PinYinChar`: Convert the same mapped codepoints to pinyin with trimmed boundaries.
  * `你好` -> `nihao`
  * `西安` -> `xian`

You can combine these transformations as needed. Pre-defined combinations like `DeleteNormalize` and `FanjianDeleteNormalize` are provided for convenience.

Including `None` in a composite `ProcessType` keeps the raw-text path alongside transformed
variants. For example, `ProcessType::None | ProcessType::PinYin` allows one part of a rule to
match the original text while another part matches the Pinyin-transformed text.

Be careful combining `PinYin` and `PinYinChar`: they preserve different word boundaries, so the
same input can behave like `xi` + `an` in one pipeline and `xian` in the other.

#### Rule syntax

* `a&b`: both sub-patterns must appear, in any order
* `a~b`: `a` must appear and `b` must stay absent
* repeated segments count: `无&法&无&天` requires two matches of `无`

### Basic Example

Here’s a basic example of how to use the `SimpleMatcher` for text matching:

```rust
use matcher_rs::{text_process, reduce_text_process, ProcessType};

let result = text_process(ProcessType::Delete, "你好，世界！");
let results = reduce_text_process(ProcessType::FanjianDeleteNormalize, "你好，世界！");
```

`text_process` returns only the final transformed text. `reduce_text_process` returns each
changed intermediate result along one pipeline. For shared-prefix multi-variant traversal,
`SimpleMatcher` uses the internal transform-tree helpers instead of recomputing each path independently.


```rust
use matcher_rs::{ProcessType, SimpleMatcherBuilder};

let matcher = SimpleMatcherBuilder::new()
    .add_word(ProcessType::Fanjian, 1, "你好")
    .add_word(ProcessType::Fanjian, 2, "世界")
    .build();

let text = "你好，世界！";
let results = matcher.process(text);
```

For more detailed usage examples, please refer to the [test_simple_matcher.rs](./tests/test_simple_matcher.rs) file.

## Feature Flags

* `perf` *(default)*: Meta-feature enabling `dfa`, `simd_runtime_dispatch`, and `harry`.
* `dfa` *(via `perf`)*: Use `aho-corasick` DFA mode for the bytewise scan engine when all patterns are ASCII and count ≤ 7,000. ~10x more memory than NFA but higher throughput up to the cache boundary.
* `simd_runtime_dispatch` *(via `perf`)*: Selects the best available transform kernel at runtime (`AVX2` on x86-64, `NEON` on ARM64, portable fallback elsewhere). Also enables NEON and AVX512-VBMI kernels in the Harry backend.
* `harry` *(via `perf`)*: Column-vector SIMD scan backend, auto-selected for `is_match` when ≥ 64 patterns exist. Handles both ASCII and non-ASCII (CJK) haystacks.
* `runtime_build`: Build transformation tables from the source text maps at runtime instead of loading build-time artifacts.

### Feature Comparison & Recommendation

| Feature | Engine | Search Speed | Memory Usage | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Default (`perf`)** | DFA + Harry + SIMD transforms | **Fastest** | Higher | General purpose use. |
| `--no-default-features --features dfa` | DFA without Harry or SIMD transforms | Fast | Higher | When Harry is not needed. |
| `--no-default-features` | `daachorse`-only matching, portable transforms, no Harry | Good | Lower | Leaner builds and feature debugging. |

## Benchmarks

Benchmarked on **MacBook Air M4 (24GB RAM)**.
Test data: [CN_WORD_LIST_100000](../data/word_list/cn/cn_words_100000.txt) against [CN_HAYSTACK](../data/text/cn/西游记.txt) and [EN_WORD_LIST_100000](../data/word_list/en/en_words_100000.txt) against [EN_HAYSTACK](../data/text/en/sherlock.txt).

Full records are stored in [bench_records/](./bench_records/). Latest: [latest.txt](./bench_records/latest.txt).

For local benchmarking, use `just` recipes from the repository root instead of ad hoc `cargo bench` runs. All bench recipes accept pass-through args (`--quick`, `--profile`, `--repeats`, etc.):

```shell
just bench-search                          # Main throughput workflow
just bench-search --quick                  # Quick directional signal (~2-3 min)
just bench-search --profile bench-dev      # Faster rebuild (thin LTO)
just bench-build                           # Matcher construction workflow
just bench-engine-search                   # Raw engine throughput workflow
just bench-engine-is-match                 # Engine is_match (Harry) workflow
just bench-all                             # All presets
```

The local protocol is:

* run benchmarks serially only
* benchmark only the preset affected by your change
* let the script warm the binary and collect repeated runs
* compare aggregated run sets, not a single median from one output file
* prefer plugged-in power, a warm build cache, and low background load
* treat rows marked noisy as informational rather than regression signals

Each run creates a timestamped directory under `matcher_rs/bench_records/` with raw outputs, `aggregate.json`, and `summary.txt`.

To compare two aggregated run sets:

```shell
just bench-compare \
  "matcher_rs/bench_records/2026-03-29_17-00-00_search" \
  "matcher_rs/bench_records/2026-03-29_17-20-00_search"
```

For a direct comparison between two single raw benchmark outputs:

```shell
just bench-compare-raw \
  "matcher_rs/bench_records/2026-03-10_12-22-24_search/raw/search-run01.txt" \
  "matcher_rs/bench_records/2026-03-11_23-16-38_search/raw/search-run01.txt"
```

The raw comparison treats the first file as the baseline and prints `Regression` and `Improvement`. The run-set comparison suppresses noisy rows by default and compares aggregate medians across repeats.
