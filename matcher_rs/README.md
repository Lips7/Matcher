# Matcher

A high-performance, multi-functional word matcher implemented in Rust.

Designed to solve **AND OR NOT** and **TEXT VARIATIONS** problems in word/word_list matching. For detailed implementation, see the [Design Document](../DESIGN.md).

## Features

- **Supports Multiple Matching Methods**:
  - Simple word matching
  - Regex-based matching
  - Similarity-based matching
- **Text Normalization Options**:
  - Fanjian (Simplify traditional Chinese characters to simplified ones)
  - Delete (Remove whitespaces, punctuation, and non-alphanumeric characters)
  - Normalize (Normalize special characters to identifiable characters)
  - PinYin (Convert Chinese characters to Pinyin for fuzzy matching)
  - PinYinChar (Convert Chinese characters to Pinyin)
- **Combination and Repeated Word Matching**:
  - Handles combination and repetition of words with specified constraints.

## Usage

### Adding to Your Project

To use `matcher_rs` in your Rust project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
matcher_rs = "*"
```

### Explaination of the configuration

* `Matcher`'s configuration is defined by the `MatchTableMap = HashMap<u64, Vec<MatchTable>>` type, the key of `MatchTableMap` is called `match_id`, for each `match_id`, the `table_id` inside **should but isn't required to be unique**.
* `SimpleMatcher`'s configuration is defined by the `SimpleMatchTableMap = HashMap<SimpleMatchType, HashMap<u64, &'a str>>` type, the value `HashMap<u64, &'a str>`'s key is called `word_id`, **`word_id` is required to be globally unique**.

#### MatchTable

* `table_id`: The unique ID of the match table.
* `match_table_type`: The type of the match table.
* `word_list`: The word list of the match table.
* `exemption_simple_match_type`: The type of the exemption simple match.
* `exemption_word_list`: The exemption word list of the match table.

For each match table, word matching is performed over the `word_list`, and exemption word matching is performed over the `exemption_word_list`. If the exemption word matching result is True, the word matching result will be False.

#### MatchTableType

* `Simple`: Supports simple multiple patterns matching with text normalization defined by `simple_match_type`.
  * We offer transformation methods for text normalization, including `Fanjian`, `Normalize`, `PinYin` ¬∑¬∑¬∑.
  * It can handle combination patterns and repeated times sensitive matching, delimited by `,`, such as `hello,world,hello` will match `hellohelloworld` and `worldhellohello`, but not `helloworld` due to the repeated times of `hello`.
* `Regex`: Supports regex patterns matching.
  * `SimilarChar`: Supports similar character matching using regex.
    * `["hello,hallo,hollo,hi", "word,world,wrd,üåç", "!,?,~"]` will match `helloworld`, `hollowrd`, `hiüåç` ¬∑¬∑¬∑ any combinations of the words split by `,` in the list.
  * `Acrostic`: Supports acrostic matching using regex **(currently only supports Chinese and simple English sentences)**.
    * `["h,e,l,l,o", "‰Ω†,Â•Ω"]` will match `hope, endures, love, lasts, onward.` and `‰Ω†ÁöÑÁ¨ëÂÆπÊ∏©Êöñ, Â•ΩÂøÉÊÉÖÂ∏∏‰º¥„ÄÇ`.
  * `Regex`: Supports regex matching.
    * `["h[aeiou]llo", "w[aeiou]rd"]` will match `hello`, `world`, `hillo`, `wurld` ¬∑¬∑¬∑ any text that matches the regex in the list.
* `Similar`: Supports similar text matching based on distance and threshold.
  * `Levenshtein`: Supports similar text matching based on Levenshtein distance.
  * `DamerauLevenshtein`: Supports similar text matching based on Damerau-Levenshtein distance.
  * `Indel`: Supports similar text matching based on Indel distance.
  * `Jaro`: Supports similar text matching based on Jaro distance.
  * `JaroWinkler`: Supports similar text matching based on Jaro-Winkler distance.

#### SimpleMatchType

* `None`: No transformation.
* `Fanjian`: Traditional Chinese to simplified Chinese transformation.
  * `Â¶≥Â•Ω` -> `‰Ω†Â•Ω`
  * `Áèæ‚æù` -> `Áé∞Ë∫´`
* `Delete`: Delete all non-alphanumeric and non-unicode Chinese characters.
  * `hello, world!` -> `helloworld`
  * `„Ää‰Ω†‚à∑Â•Ω„Äã` -> `‰Ω†Â•Ω`
* `Normalize`: Normalize all English character variations and number variations to basic characters.
  * `‚Ñã–Ä‚íà„à†œï` -> `he11o`
  * `‚íà∆ß„äÇ` -> `123`
* `PinYin`: Convert all unicode Chinese characters to pinyin with boundaries.
  * `‰Ω†Â•Ω` -> `‚êÄni‚êÄ‚êÄhao‚êÄ`
  * `Ë•øÂÆâ` -> `‚êÄxi‚êÄ‚êÄan‚êÄ`
* `PinYinChar`: Convert all unicode Chinese characters to pinyin without boundaries
  * `‰Ω†Â•Ω` -> `nihao`
  * `Ë•øÂÆâ` -> `xian`

You can combine these transformations as needed. Pre-defined combinations like `DeleteNormalize` and `FanjianDeleteNormalize` are provided for convenience.

Avoid combining `PinYin` and `PinYinChar` due to that `PinYin` is a more limited version of `PinYinChar`, in some cases like `xian`, can be treat as two words `xi` and `an`, or only one word `xian`.

### Limitations

Simple Match can handle words with a maximum of **32** combined words (more than 32 then effective combined words are not guaranteed) and **8** repeated words (more than 8 repeated words will be limited to 8).

### Basic Example

Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to use the `Matcher` struct for text matching:

```rust
use matcher_rs::{text_process, reduce_text_process, SimpleMatchType};

let result = text_process(SimpleMatchType::TextDelete, "‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºå‰∏ñÁïåÔºÅ");
let result = reduce_text_process(SimpleMatchType::FanjianDeleteNormalize, "‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºå‰∏ñÁïåÔºÅ");
```

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use matcher_rs::{Matcher, MatchTableMap, MatchTable, MatchTableType, SimpleMatchType};

let match_table_map: MatchTableMap = HashMap::from_iter(vec![
    (1, vec![MatchTable {
        table_id: 1,
        match_table_type: MatchTableType::Simple { simple_match_type: SimpleMatchType::FanjianDeleteNormalize},
        word_list: vec!["example", "test"],
        exemption_simple_match_type: SimpleMatchType::FanjianDeleteNormalize,
        exemption_word_list: vec![],
    }]),
]);
let matcher = Matcher::new(&match_table_map);
let text = "This is an example text.";
let results = matcher.word_match(text);
```

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use matcher_rs::{SimpleMatchType, SimpleMatcher};

let mut simple_match_type_word_map = HashMap::default();
let mut simple_word_map = HashMap::default();

simple_word_map.insert(1, "‰Ω†Â•Ω");
simple_word_map.insert(2, "‰∏ñÁïå");

simple_match_type_word_map.insert(SimpleMatchType::Fanjian, simple_word_map);

let matcher = SimpleMatcher::new(&simple_match_type_word_map);
let text = "‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºå‰∏ñÁïåÔºÅ";
let results = matcher.process(text);
```

## Benchmarks

The `matcher_rs` library includes benchmarks to measure the performance of the matcher. You can find the benchmarks in the [bench.rs](./benches/bench.rs) file. To run the benchmarks, use the following command:

```shell
cargo bench
```
